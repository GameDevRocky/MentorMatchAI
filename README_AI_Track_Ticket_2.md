# AI Track Ticket 2: Semantic Mentor Recommendation System

## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains a working semantic recommendation system that matches students with mentors based on their interests and expertise using AI techniques like TF-IDF, LSA, and cosine similarity. The system is designed to be robust, efficient, and easy to use.

## 📁 File Structure

```
MentorMatchAI/
├── mentor_recommender.R           # Main mentor recommendation system
├── test_mentor_recommender.R      # Comprehensive test script
├── README_AI_Track_Ticket_2.md   # This documentation
└── sample_mentors.db             # Sample database (created by test script)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Required Packages

```r
# Install required packages
install.packages(c("text2vec", "Matrix", "proxy", "stopwords", "DBI", "RSQLite"))

# Load libraries
library(text2vec)
library(Matrix)
library(proxy)
library(stopwords)
library(DBI)
library(RSQLite)
```

### 2. Test with Realistic Student Data

```bash
# Run the quick start script with realistic student questionnaire data
Rscript quick_start_ai_ticket_2.R
```

This script tests the system with 4 realistic student profiles that match the actual student questionnaire structure:

1. **Data Science Student** → Should match with Dr. Sarah Chen (Data Scientist)
2. **UX Design Student** → Should match with David Kim (UX Design Lead)  
3. **Career Exploration Student** → Should match with Alex Rodriguez (Career Counselor)
4. **DevOps Student** → Should match with James Parker (DevOps Engineer)

### 3. Run Comprehensive Tests

```r
# Run the comprehensive test script
source('test_mentor_recommender.R')
```

### 4. Use the Recommender

```r
# Load the mentor recommender functions
source('mentor_recommender.R')

# Connect to database
con <- dbConnect(SQLite(), "sample_mentors.db")

# Create embedding system
embedding_system <- default_embedding_system(con)

# Get recommendations for a student
student_interests <- c("machine learning", "python", "data science")
recommendations <- get_mentor_recommendations(student_interests, embedding_system, 3)

# Display results
for (i in 1:length(recommendations)) {
  mentor <- recommendations[[i]]
  cat(sprintf("%d. %s (%s) - Similarity: %.3f\n", 
              i, mentor$name, mentor$title, mentor$score))
}

# Close database connection
dbDisconnect(con)
```

## 🔧 System Architecture

### Core Functions

1. **`get_mentor_data(con)`**
   - Retrieves mentor data from SQLite database
   - Supports both enhanced and basic mentor tables
   - Handles missing data gracefully

2. **`default_embedding_system(con)`**
   - Creates TF-IDF + LSA embeddings for mentor profiles
   - Combines name, title, expertise, bio, and demographic data
   - Implements robust error handling for matrix operations

3. **`get_mentor_recommendations(student_answers, embedding_system, top_k)`**
   - Processes student queries through the same embedding pipeline
   - Calculates cosine similarity between student and mentor vectors
   - Returns top-k most similar mentors with similarity scores

### Technical Implementation

#### Text Processing Pipeline
1. **Tokenization**: Breaks text into individual words
2. **Stopword Removal**: Removes common words like "the", "and", "is"
3. **Case Normalization**: Converts all text to lowercase
4. **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts text to numerical vectors
5. **LSA Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduces vector dimensions while preserving meaning
6. **Cosine Similarity**: Calculates similarity between vectors

#### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE mentors_enhanced (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  expertise_areas TEXT NOT NULL,
  bio TEXT,
  email TEXT,
  location TEXT,
  industry TEXT,
  experience_years INTEGER,
  age_range TEXT,
  gender TEXT,
  ethnicity TEXT
)
```
